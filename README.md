# Project Overview

This project is a 2 month assignment that is apart of the "Introduction to Software Engineering" course that we take in our 3rd year at the Computer Science Enginnering school *Ecole nationale Supérieure d’Informatique, ESI Alger*
Savantia is a comprehensive web application designed to facilitate the search, retrieval, and management of scientific articles for researchers, academics, and enthusiasts. This platform offers a user-friendly interface tailored to the needs of clients, moderators, and administrators, each with distinct roles and functionalities. 


# Key Features
### API Endpoints:

- Define RESTful endpoints to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend systems.
- Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing articles, users, and system configurations.
- Ensure data integrity and security through authentication and authorization mechanisms.
### Data Processing:

- Develop modules for parsing and extracting information from PDF articles.
- Implement algorithms for text analysis and keyword extraction to enhance search capabilities.
- Integrate with Elasticsearch for efficient indexing and retrieval of article metadata.

### Database Management:


- Use PostgreSQL for persistent storage of article metadata, user profiles, and system configurations.
- Implement data modeling and schema design to accommodate the complex structure of scientific articles.


### For Moderators:


- Manage the validation process of articles.
- Modify, delete, and validate articles for publication.
- Correct errors in the extracted information from PDF articles.
- Monitor unvalidated articles and ensure quality control.
### For Clients (Authenticated Users):


- Search for scientific articles based on keywords in the title, keywords, authors, and full text.
- Filter search results based on keywords, authors, institutions, or publication date range.
- View details of each article including full text in text and PDF format.
- Save favorite articles for later consultation.
- Access the list of previously saved favorite scientific articles.
### For Admins:


- Manage moderators.
- Initiate upload operations of scientific articles.
- Monitor system statistics and analytics through a comprehensive dashboard.
